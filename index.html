          <h2>- an aspiring UX/UI Designer</h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> I am an architect by profession with a passion for new technologies. Recently I have started to be interested in UX Design and I fell in love with it. Since then, I have been trying to develop in this direction.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 5%;">I know that some skills acquired while working as an architect will be very useful for me. I believe that the process of working as a UX Designer is very similar to designing a building. First you need to do user research to gather their requirements, next you deal with room planning, which can be compared to information architecture. Then you create a model of the building and test the users whether they will feel comfortable in the designed space. Finally, you propose an interior finish that needs the same sense of aesthetics as when designing interfaces.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 5%;">All these things make me think that I will fit perfectly in the world of UX Design.

          <p>During conference Elementarz UX #2 we were talking about a lack of movement caused by today's situation - working from home and limited activities outside. We had taken a challenge to design app motivating peole to live more active inside their houses. We focused on building a new rutine, which after a while will be executed effortlessly.

          <p>Recently I have taken part in a social hackathon, which concentrated around people with different kind of disabilities. The task was to come up with the idea of an app which could make easier everyday activities. Me and my group focused on elderly people and people with vision problems. The activity we wanted to improve was shopping.
